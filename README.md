# CS 230 – Operating Platforms  
### Module Eight Journal – Portfolio Reflection

**Client Summary**  
The Gaming Room is a game development company that originally built a game called *Draw It or Lose It* for Android. They want to expand this app across other operating platforms while maintaining performance, usability, and scalability.

**What I Did Well**  
I clearly documented the software’s architecture, including how memory and storage would be managed on different platforms. I made sure the software design could scale across multiple OS environments like Linux, Windows, and macOS while staying modular and efficient.

**Helpful Aspects of the Design Document**  
The process of outlining the software architecture before coding helped me organize thoughts, anticipate resource limitations, and better communicate expectations with future development teams.

**What I Would Revise**  
I would improve the visuals in the design doc—like flow diagrams or platform architecture—so it’s easier to explain the relationships between system components at a glance.

**How I Interpreted User Needs**  
I translated the client’s focus on scalability and user experience into platform-specific solutions—especially ensuring high-performance image rendering and smooth gameplay regardless of device.

**How I Approach Software Design**  
I use platform comparisons, system resource planning, and user-centered design. In the future, I’ll continue to start with scalability and cross-platform support to create reusable, modular components.
